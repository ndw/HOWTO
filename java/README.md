# In a Java Application

The small Java application in this directory is an example of how you
might use the [CoffeeFilter](https://coffeefilter.nineml.org/) library
in your own JVM applications. (This application is Java, but the
library should be callable from any JVM language.)

The `demo` task will build and run the application.
